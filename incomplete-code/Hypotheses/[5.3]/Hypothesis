Identify single charge, i.e. only +ive or -ive charge.
if Prob Pion < Value 1 delete whole set, otherwise continue

Left with 2 identically charged particles.
Probabilty of Kaon vs Pion for both
if prob kaon for both particles > Value 2 delete whole set, otherwise continue
if prob pion for both particles > Value 2 delete whole set, otherwise continue

If particle 1 Prob K or Prob Pi > Value 3 keep
If particle 2 Prob K or Prob Pi > Value 3 keep

Result: Filtered to Kpipi decay with accuracy perameter.
